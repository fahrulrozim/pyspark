# pyspark

This is a repository for `Session 5 - Data Engineer Fellowship Program By IYKRA`. The topic in this session is `Data Visualization and Introduction to Batch Processing`.

In data visualization, we used Google Data Studio as a way to create dashboard for our data visualization. The project that I'm doing is using `Green Taxi Trip Data` from this [link](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page). For the sake of simplicity, I'm just taking the data from `green taxi in August 2021`. If you want to access the dashboard that I created, you can move to link below.
